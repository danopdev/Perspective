# Perspective #

Android application to fix perspective in photos.
Internaly it uses OpenCL to load / save and warp photos.

There is an auto-detection (but doesn't work correctly all the time).

For edit mode you can lock a direction (horizontal or vertical) so you can move points only in one direction.
